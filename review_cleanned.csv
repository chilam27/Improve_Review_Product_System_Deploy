Dickies standardize your production, please
","
Dickies... you are starting to breaking my heart.  I have been ferociously loyal to you ever since I discovered your Original work pants back in 2010; I have always found your Original work pants to be comfortable, easy to care for and durable.  The last three pairs I have purchased probably puts my grand total up over ten pairs.However... I am beginning to notice an issue with the consistency of the waist size.  I am a 32"" waist, I know this because if I take a tailor's measuring tape and wrap it around my waist the starting ends meets the rest of the tape at, you guessed it, the 32"" mark.  I mention this standard unit of measure because the last three pairs of pants I have purchased from you have not, in fact, been sized/manufactured/labeled correctly.  Three pairs ago was a pair of 32x32 (my size for the last 6 years in these pants) and they were way too tight in the waist, I couldn't even imagine trying to go to work in those.  So a quick return and I order two pairs of 33x32, thinking that maybe your specs have changed over the last year or so.  Well, much to my disappointment these two pairs of pants aren't even uniform with one another: one is a true 33"" waist but the other is LESS than 32"" in the waist - it's like 31.5""!  So shame on me because I removed the tags of the second pair before I put them on, so now I can't return them.Like I said, generally speaking I really like this product and will likely order more of these pants in the future, but please fix whatever it is that's going on to effect your consistency is such a negative way.

THREE CHINOS

I ordered and received 3 pairs of ChinosAll the same day.Here are the results1 ~ IZOD Men's American Chino Flat Front Pant, Black, 36W x 32LThese are 100% Cotton and fit exactly the same as all my 36W x 32 L Wrangler jeans. love them. Perfect fit, perfect weight of fabric and all cotton. The perfect Chino.2 `~ Amazon Essentials Men's Classic-Fit Wrinkle-Resistant Flat-Front Chino Pant 36 x 32These are 60% Cotton, 40% Polyester and fit TIGHTER than the Izod. The fabric is of the same thickness as the IZOD. My main complaint is they fit too tight and the waist rolls over. That doesn't happen wtih the IZOD3 ~ Dickies Men's Original 874 Work Pant 36 x 32 These are 65% Polyester/35% Cotton. The fabric of this product is MUCH thicker than the IZOD and the Amazon Essentials. More like a thin Bluejean than a Chino. The MAIN problem is, I CAN'T GET THESE ON. The fit is SO tight I cannot CLOSE them no matter what I do. I tried lying on my bed, letting all my breath out and I STILL can't close them. This is REALLY a pathetic fit. As I said, I bought ALL three items on the same day and tried them before and after one washing for fit.SO, in my opinion, because of the VERY TIGHT FIT and the coarse and thicker fabric, I would say STAY AWAY from this item.The Amazon Essentials are good. Just wish the fit was a little looser in the waist compared to what they sent.The BEST of the bunch is the IZOD Men's American Chino Flat Front Pant. PERIODThe Dickies and Amazon brand are about 20 bucks each,The IZOD is $25 bucks.GO FOR THE EXTRA 5 BUCKS! and get the IZOD.

Perfect for work in the Food and Beverage industry

Perfect for work in the Food and Beverage industry, retail, deli, meat cotter, etc...  One small sizing note... I wear 34"" waist in most everything... I ordered that size first and they almost cut me in half trying to get through the whole day.  Very tight in the waist, but fit nicely in the butt, crotch and thighs.  So, I ordered the next size up, these 36"" inch ones thinking they should fit better.  Well, the waist was good.  And let me be clear, I am an actual 34"" waist guy... I am not in denial and not trying to jam a beer gut into pants that just aren't my size... These run small in the waist.  With that said, when Dickies goes from a 34"" waist to the 36"" waist, they make EVERYTHING bigger.  The waist fits great.  The butt area was literally twice the size.  So, I can breath now, but I have 80 year old man ass.Lastly and on a more positive note... These are built amazingly.  They will last you a long time.  They are super high quality, the pockets are cut perfectly, they hold a crease and look like new after every wash with no ironing.

Apparently a size 30 to these people translates to a size 25! Could barely get them over my thighs! What the hell Amazon/Dickies? Absolutely can't wear, as the clasps are around 1 inch from being able to close even in the most uncomfortable and tightest efforts. Buyer be ware! Will never buy from them again..(For the record I'm a loose wearing size 30 and am by no means unable to fit into an actual size 30 as it's what I currently wear everyday to work in pants made by multiple brands and have never had an issue.)

Very disappointed in size
","
Bought these for work pants, but also to hopefully replace the need for jeans. I stated with a 28 x 30 which is my normal size with other pants. The waist was much to tight to the point of pain. So i returned the pants and tried a 29 x 30 pair. This pair now is to loose around the waist by about 2 inches and the legs are to long by about 1-2 inches. Also it causes a large gap in the back of the waistline. I am having to many problems to give any further information. I must give up on this, and move on to something else.Also note: these pants are very very stiff at first. I'm not sure how much they will loosen up after a few washes since I never got to that point.

I have only bought Dickie work clothes since 1978 for myself and all the guys in my shop.  I was loyal to Dickie and would never think to buy another brand.  These pants do not fit my 135 Lb skinny body.  In the past I would order 30 x 30 without a thought.  These pants have a crummy short zipper and a crotch that has no room. Odd for the pants billed as original 874 fit.  I thought this must be a one time looser but I bought 2 other styles of Dickie pants recently with the same problem.Something has happened to the company to the point that they have driven away a loyal customer.  I am experimenting now with Red Kap.  Hopefully the supervise there offshore factories better.

Great pair of pants for a great pair of legs

So after looking in stores all around the Tampa Bay Area, I can’t find pants that I feel fit me the way I like.  So I turned to Amazon.  I’ve always liked Dickies pants in the past, and on Amazon, I’m able to find a vast range of sizes.  Found these bad boys and I couldn’t order them fast enough.First off, you can expect the same high-quality material as any Dickies pants bought from a store.  A tough waist band, pockets in the right places, and fits just as I’d expected.  With that being said, I’ve always found Dickies pants to run a little tight, and yes these are a little tight, AS EXPECTED.  If I go to Chipotle and get my usual beef burrito or to Outback for a 12oz sirloin with baked potato, salad and broccoli, these pants will fit much tighter than expected!  I would love for Dickies to incorporate a flexible waistband for my glutinous dinners, but alas, I enjoy these pants.  I would most likely be ordering them again.

The sizing is completely labeled wrong

I normally wear a 36 pants in jeans. These did not fit what so ever on me. I took a tailor's tape to see what the actual size is. They are labeled 36 but are size 30. Really disappointed with this. I ended up giving them to my friend who is a lot smaller than me and it fit him though he had to hem the legs because I am a tall and he is short. I would never buy any Dickies pants from Amazon again. I bought two pairs in two different colors. One was labeled ""Made in China"" the other was labeled ""Made in Mexico"". If you still want to buy them after I said my bit. Good Luck. They also shrink for some reason. And when I washed them I just used the Washing Machine and hung them up to dry in my spare bedroom.

Order Yours a Couple Sizes Larger.  These Tend to Run Small.

First of all, the pants look great!  Pure white, and well finished.  These will be close to perfect for what I need them for....once I get some that fit.Now for the not so good:  The sizes seem to run small, which is unusual for Dickies.  I ordered a 38 inch waist band, but the pants I received are way smaller than that.  My guess would be that they are actually 34-35 inch waist..  I normally wear a 36 inch waist pants, but wanted something with a little more room to tuck in the uniform shirt.I am going to re-order these in a 40 inch waist.  Still a fan of Dickies workwear, and will recommend these if you need something really white and durable.  Just remember to order yours a couple sizes larger than you normally wear.The reason I docked a star is because of the sizing issue.  No issues with quality or appearance.  We will see how the new ones fit.

These are great work pants, hence the reason my husband buys these 874 dickies. Problem is you can’t confidently order these online. There is no quality control. If you want dickies YOU HAVE TO BUY LOCAL!!  I ordered 3 pairs of 34x32 for my husband. One pair was correct in size, the other two were at least 2 inches smaller in the waist despite being labeled 34x32. I should have read through the reviews more closely because I see that this is a problem that’s been happening for a looong time. We buy online to save on trips to town from the ranch, but now we have to go In to return these to the UPS terminal anyhow... Defeats the purpose of buying this product online. Live and learn 😒

I'm a skinny, kinda tall guy. I find anytime I wear pants that fit my waist and height. My pockets are useless, and my junk is plain and visible for the world to see.But with these pants, so long as I'm wearing boxers, the crotch has plenty of room, and the pockets are actually usable. The only qualm I have with them are the belt loops. For such a functional pair of pants, the belt loops are pretty small. Making it impossible for me to wear my sturdier belt, suited for the various pouches I wear daily as an electrician.*edit*I forgot to mention, while these pants do have a pretty excessive amount of belt loops,making it difficult to use some wide belt pouches, you can get around this inconvenience easily by just using every other loop rather than every loop. you can even alternate the loops you use to spread out wear and tear so you can get some more mileage out of them if often put a lot of tension on them. Still wish they would make the loops larger, These would be absolutely perfect.

These Are Sturdy, Value Priced Work Pants For Everyone, Male Or Female!
","
I'm very happy with these pants. I love gardening and working around my home in ways that often involve crawling around on the ground, changing oil in yard machines or digging, which is not what you want to do in work pants you have forked over 75 bucks for to a woman's work wear catalog that restricts pants lengths and sizes. These pants let me do that without straining or restricting my movement. At $23 a pair I bought two brown and two black pairs at a little more than I would have paid and outfitted them with two inexpensive web belts to accommodate a belt belt sheath for a pruner. I am delighted with them. They soften up a bit after washing but still maintain a neat appearance.I am hardly the first woman to buy men's pants or jeans for working in because of the more varied sizing and lengths they are available in, as well as the frequently better price. Remember ladies, they ain't ""men's pants"" when you're in 'em!

Sizing Is Way Off - Order In Larger Size
","
As everyone knows, pant sizes always vary. For context I wear Dickies double knee work pants for work which are a size 34x32 that fit a little snug. Same with jeans, size 34 waist fit a little snug, but 36’s damn near fall off if anything heavy is in the pocket. So when I ordered these pants for a Jason Voorhees costume, I decided to just get a 36x32 so it would fit a little loose and I’d just wear a belt. Unfortunately when it arrived, I couldn’t even zip them up they were so tight, and the ends of the pants were like a solid few inches from hooking together, so there was so sucking it in to connect.These pair of pants run really small. I went to the mall down the road to see if I could find a pair of these pants in a larger size, which they had but not in this silver color that I needed. So I test fitted the pants they did have and the sizes didn’t get comfortable until I hit a 40 waist. That’s ridiculous, in the same brand I fit a 34. If you order these, get at least a size or two larger. Only reason I’m giving three stars is because with Prime, I got them pretty fast. I’ve place another order for a 40x32 in silver, hopefully there won’t be any tomfoolery

Based on reviews, I ordered a size up. I needed to order at least 2 sizes up, and considering shrinkage, probably three sizes up. That's crazy. That would make it 3 stars at worst, but having to pay to return and not being able to simply execute an exchange drop it one star.  $7+ to return, and I have to re-order in an appropriate size. Plus, this is the only Prime order I have ever had to pay return shipping on. I rarely need to return anything and I object to it not being made clear in advance that there would be a hassle involved in exchanging these Dickies Men's Original 874 Work Pants.

In reality nice enough to wear with a button down shirt out ...

Husband uses these pants for all his outdoor activities. They've become his favorites. The color is closer to a dark forest green rather than olive drab, but still very neutral. Wash up well-possibly have stain release because even red mud washes out without pre treating. Would give 5 stars if the fabric was a little smoother and if they had a button or snap closure (they have a metal hook and eye that won't stay closed in the washing machine.) They come out of the dryer wrinkle-free. Have probably been washed a dozen times already, and holding up very well. They fit him exactly true to size for waist and length, but not baggy in the butt. A straight leg not too wide but wide enough to fit over boot tops. In reality nice enough to wear with a button down shirt out for dinner at a sit down restaurant. Such a good price I would actually give 4.5 stars. Am going to reorder.

GET TWO SIZES BIG TRUST ME (exp 32 get 36)

On this review I would have given it 5 Stars if I wouldn't have had to buy another pair because I didn't know that these pants run two sizes too small. When I first bought these I bought them in my correct size that I get in every pants but I got it in one half size bigger (I'm a 32 but got 33 for little more flexibility) and it did not fit at all it was literally probably a 29 because not even my brother could fit into them and he's a size 30.

Waste smaller than I expected
","
I ordered another pair since overall they seemed like what I was looking for.  I'm ""high waisted"" and wanted pants that sit high just below the belly button.  These did.  But although I've lost several pounds and normally wear a 32 or at most 33 waist these were very tight.  Could be because they sit so high?  But it's something to consider if you're looking at these.  I was able to get them fastened (metal hook style) but way too tight to be comfortable so I ordered a 34 and hope it'll be about right but not too loose if I lose a few more pounds.

As soon as I opened the plastic bag that actually contained the pants, not just the Amazon package but the bag the pants were actually in, it smelled of rubber. At first I thought it smelled like burnt rubber, but when I smell the pants themselves they reeked of a rubber smell. I was disgusted, infuriated, but remained calm.I took them through the wash and the smell is gone. I don't know what's going on in the storage facility that these came out of, but someone needs to get there Warehouse straight. That smell was enough that I almost return these.Otherwise, these look exactly the way I expected them to look.

Solid pair of durable workpants. I've had a black pair for a while now that I tapered in the past, so I thought it was time to get a pair in navy.For those of you that haven't purchased a pair of 874's before, here are some things to know.They sit at your natural waist. This is something that you have to get used to if you currently wear low waisted pants. It can be uncomfortable to begin with, but overall its more flattering for your posterior and waist.They are a little snug around the thighs and flare at the ankles. If you have larger thighs like me, it can be a little restrictive. I'm 6'1 and 150 lbs, leaning towards the skinny side. I got them in a size 30 x 29 so I could have them slightly cropped. In the past, I had a 30x30, which fit pretty much perfectly with a cuff.Here are some of my cons regarding the pants. Out of the package, the starchiness of the pants can be a little abrasive on your thighs. This is something I got used to, but be warned. The first pair is always damn itchy. The center crease and the starchiness of the pants disappear after a couple washes. After about 2 washes, the center crease becomes almost unnoticeable. It takes about 20-30 washes for it to be slightly softer. I wish it would stay starchy for longer, but that's just a consequence of washing your clothes. I also dislike the way the fly bulges outwards near the belt. It's a hook and loop closure, which doesn't sit as flush as a button and buttonhole closure. This makes it push out near the belt loops.All in all, it's a steal for the price. Sturdy construction, classic colors, and cheap price. Would definitely recommend.

Inconsistent size and quality, never buying another pair
","
I've had enough of these, I'll never buy another.  I've gotten a few of these over the last few years and found the waist fitment to be snug, but close enough for a work pant that I didn't want to belt.  But this last pair I got I could barely pull them up over my thighs and couldn't even get close to latching them.  I took them off and measured the band and compared it to one of my it-fits-but-its-snug pair and they measured THREE INCHES less!  And they are tagged as the same size.  Yeah, right.  Worst of all I had already removed the tags and washed them beforehand since the last four pairs had fit, so I'm stuck with them.The inconsistent sizing isn't the only reason I'm swearing off these.  The stitching quality is also all over the place.  I've had pairs with no problems, but others that have blown a seam in weeks.  The weirdo small waist pair had the corner of one of the pockets blow out when I was taking them off, and I hadn't even worn them for a single day yet (...because they didn't fit).  I've had another pair where the zipper refused to stay zipped and I had to add a loop to the zipper pull that fit into the latch so it couldn't fall down once the paints were clasped.Sorry Dickies, you've lost me as a customer.

Defect on fabric and...

I found this white-line on the back of the leg. I tried wiping it off but it wouldn't come off so I took a closer look and seems to be a defect, somehow. I ordered two sizes, to save time (36 and 38) and was surprised that the 38 waist was still very tight but I needed something for tomorrow so I needed to make a choice. Either take it or go to work and meet my bosses out-of-uniform. The pants were extremely long, usually, a 34 inseam fits fine but not this time and had to do some last-minute sewing. I decided not to cut so the additional hem I needed was 4inches on each leg.  Do you do any quality control?

Bought these for use at work. I work in a hospital environment where I have to look professional but can get messy at times. I spent $ 25 on each pair of pants and they look like more expensive pants. They feel a little funny at first. Very stiff the first time you wear them. Belt loops just barely fit my belt. The front pockets are somewhat smaller than my jeans pockets. But they are very durable and easy to clean when you get into a mess. They definitely fit the ""office Casual"" dress code. Perfect for my job. I'd assume they'd be good for many applications. Car repair, pest control, restaurant or other jobs where there is a need to look decent but not worry so much about your clothes getting dirty. Two thumbs up!!! Highly recommended.

Bought a few pair of these. Fit was good and my favorite thing about the Dickies pants is their flexibility at work. I sometimes have to navigate my big body into awkward positions and the last thing I need is to be fighting my pants while doing so.That is where the positive ends though. The second time I wore one pair an almost perfectly right angle hole formed around the left pocket. I can't thing of what could have caused this except a defect in the fabric. Long lasting wear for work is supposed to be one of the strong suits when going with Dickies.May have to look elsewhere to see if I can find the flexibility offered here without poor quality control.

Just Right (for Me)

I'm short and I'm skinny. For me, these pants fit great at the waist- no bagginess and while I wear a belt, there's no need to. My Greek beer belly hangs over the waist in the most perfect of ways. If you like a roomy waist, order up. But what if you have to outrun a wild animal, like a bear? Be careful.The length is also wonderful; not too long and not too short. My Dickies dungarees are too long by a few inches and so I roll those up like a 50's greaser; but I don't need to do so with these. There's plenty of room in the thighs/legs, but not too much room. I can leave the excess of the last few decades behind without being forced to embrace men's yoga pants.I love these pants. I plan to buy anywhere between one and one million more pairs.Peace.

Very versatile pants for both tough work and business casual
","
These are very versatile pants.  They can be worn for dirty jobs or even with a tie if you like in a more business casual setting.  In my case, I am a middle school teacher and teach theater tech so I spend time building and working on sets in the theater.  Additionally, I have to wear a tie and dress shirt when I teach in the classroom.  These pants work for both.  Off comes the shirt and tie when I build sets and back on when I enter the classroom.  These pants wash easily, don't need ironing when taken out of the dryer quickly, are tough/durable, and as I said, versatile.  That said, I wouldn't wear them in a very dressy environment as the pants do have a ""Dickies"" tag visibly below the rear pocket.  The two navy choices (dark and light), olive, and khaki work well in a business casual setting.These are great in the winter but can be a little warm in the summer.  The material is very tough and pretty thick compared to regular cotton khakis so that's worth considering.As many have said, get one size larger than you are.  They run just a little big IMHO.

These pants are now 8 months old.My husband is a dialysis patient so often has blood spills. We also live on a farm, with real animals.Nothing has stained these pants. NOT blood, animal manure, grass, or grease.So far with a bit of stain removal or peroxide (to get blood out), even the tan trousers look like new.For those that dislike creases(?) You might not like these.The crease is perfect, and he now has 4 pairs of trousers I don't have to iron at all. Even when he leaves tossed in the chair over night, he looks  very well groomed next day.

I've been buying these pants in charcoal, khaki, and now black for the past 3 years. My husband said these are the best work pants he has ever owned. According to him, they are sturdy and comfortable. They do not pinch or ""crowd"" him, and he finds it easy to squat, kneel, and move at work.The biggest issue is the size. These run small as everyone has been saying. We were surprised when we ordered his true size and had to send them back. So, I just keep re-ordering the larger size so that they can fit. I will admit that these pants last so long that we keep forgetting the larger size isn't incorrect. (He is a 38 and I had to purchase a 42- Not a tailored-fit. They are a bit too big in some places.)Overall, they are worth the buy.

Great pants at a good price makes them a really great value

I have 2 pair of 874's and couple other Dickies pants.I like the 'weight' and thickness of the fabric.  Stiff when new, but I like how durable they are.They are a bit small, but I'm between 36 and 38, so the 38's actually fit me better than most other pants.Permanent press and stain resistance are bonuses that make them even more versatile.I like the style - or is it lack of style.  They are just pants, which is just what I want.I'm not crazy about the wide and short (height) belt loops.  Means I can't wear my wide and thick belt with these.  And I can't clip things to the belt loops without using an adapter I made from paracord.I'm also not a fan of the front tab-slot connector.  Sometimes when I tighten my belt it comes un-done.

Ive been wearing dickies for over 25 years...Ive had many types of pants like the cargo pocket pants, the flex material pants, dickies shorts and the 874 pants.The 874's seem to retain their color and sturdiness the best...I believe they are a slighty thicker material than all the other types of dickies. I generally get 12 to 18 months out of them working in a sheetmetal environment as for all the other pants they would wear thin and get faded in 4-6 months.This is rotating 5-6 pairs of pants 6 days a week.I like them a little loose on the legs/thighs so I generally buy up 1 size on the waist.

I purchased these for my boyfriend to wear to work. He will tear through your average pair of jeans there in a week, but these have really held up. At work he does lots of squatting, bending, works with grinders, paint, and so on. They've held up well for the past 2 months, no signs of the usual crotch tears or zipper separation. He told me they fit well, we ordered one size up in the waist for better freedom of movement. Nothing really to report negatively. Great size selection as his is sometimes hard to find in stores, colors true to description, and at a great price! Once he burns through a few more pairs of old pants they will be replaced with these.

Mine fits great thanks to following the majority reviewers' advice to go one size larger.... I had been wearing size 33 in another brand of khaki pants, trying to loose weight, I would like the idea of fitting into 32 and I can with some pants.... I swallowed my pride and ordered 34.. Good fit, fits more like the 33 in the other Khakis I had.Summed up Great price and seems they may well last longer than other higher priced pants. Also great color selection! Totally recommend.

These 32in waist Dickies are smaller in the waist than the 32in double knee Dickies (both regular and relaxed fit). I am trying to lose weight, so I'm hoping they'll fit better soon, but as is... I can only wear them for a limited time, without tucking in a shirt, when I'm not sitting much, not to a big meal.... or some combination there of. I've laid them across Dickies I've had over the last 3 years, as well as some I received in this same shipment... all 32s.... ALL bigger than this pair. I actually came back to this listing to see what I'd ordered, and double checked the tags to make sure everything was right. Either Dickie's screwed up, or this ""cut"" is simply not to size (other reviews hint towards this)

Absolute Wrong Fit and Horrible Quality Assurance

First of all I ordered a 36W / 37L, and I received a 36UU. I don’t know what UU means, but if this supposed to be a 36W, it is not. All my pants are 36W, but this does not even come close. I had probably a good 3-4” before these would even come close to uncomfortably fitting me before exploding.Even worse, look at my picture of the pants. That is the bottom of my pants! Notice how it’s just cut off at the bottom in a saw pattern. Good grief! There is nothing sewn at the bottom. It is literally cut off in a zig zag. What kind of quality assurance is happening at Dickies?This is the first and last time I buy anything from Dickies. The pants themselves also feel cheap and thin.

Waistband material not as sturdy as past pairs. Decreasing material quality is a bad decision.
","
Over the last  five years, I have noticed the quality of materials in these pants decreasing. For example, the waistband material is not as stiff and the pant crease is lost after only a three washings.  The waist band now loses its shape and curls easily and I have even found the metal hook at the bottom of my clothes washing machine when it just fell off the pants.  It's disappointing to find the quality of the product less while the price remains stable. I understand that items cost more over time. The quality should remain high and the price can rise.  I shop for quality items not lowest price.

Slacks are well made and sturdy material with more thickness than typical, nice attention to detail.

Quality materials and custom sizing appreciated but you may need to go an inch larger in the waist.

I would have returned them but I needed a pair this weekend. The grey ones pictures were brand new and did have tags and stickers.....and a nice crease.

There is no where in this world that these are sized correctly!  Dickies needs to reconsider their sizes, and label them honestly.  All three pairs are going back, and quite frankly, I'm disappointed at just how small they were.  My husband tried these on in store, just to see what size would have worked, and barely fit into 3 sizes up in this 874 cut.  He's the same size in every other brand, so it's just in Dickies.If you do order them, SIZE UP.  Like way up.

Don’t waste money at urban outfitters

I keep getting ads for urban outfitters high waisted dickies but they’re expensive and I was honestly about to buy them..then I found these for way cheaper. They’re sooooo cute they literally look exactly the same as the urban outfitters ones, if you wear them high on your waist. I generally wear a women’s 0-2 depending on the pants and I bought 27w 28l and they’re perfect. They are high waters but that’s what I wanted. I do have to use a belt because they gap a little in the waist when they’re pulled up.

If you haven't worn Dickies brand clothes, I'll break it down real quick: it's a durable clothing that allows you to choose color and style that match both your needs and your penchant.  You have to read the featues of the pants before you buy them and look at them carefully because there are minor variations that make them suitable for different work environments. The different types are actually different pants/ shirts / coats etc. entirely.  Don't get click happy and buy one with an unwanted tool loop or a cell pocket or reinforced exterior joint stitching just because you didn't read.I've never had deviations in Dickies. I get what I expect. Every. Single. Time. I wish more clothing companies had this much consistency.

I trusted the reviews and they came through for us!  I read the amount of reviews saying to go a size up - Jim wears a 36 x 36  - He always has - he is a tall, lean man and 38's in other brands would have been too large and remained that way after washing - they would have just been uncomfortable in some areas due to the extra material.  So, I went the next size up on these - he said they felt good - he wore them with a belt - the next day - I washed them - no shrinkage - Perfect!  He said they are comfortable and he can bend and squat, get on his knees to pull weeds, climb a tree branch to trim, etc without feeling uncomfortable.  We are so happy about finding these and the price here on Amazon.  I will be ordering a few more now that we know.We have been buying his pants at Gander for twice the price due to his height and size - within months - he had a hole in knees due to his job as a landscaper - I hope these last longer than months but for the price - we are happy to try them.  We ordered the olive which is a fabulous color and matches everything.  Jim has been wearing this daily for a few weeks now and very happy with them - we are not seeing any wear signs in the knees and the color has stayed true.Thank you reviewers!!!  Thank you Amazon for carrying these!Landscaper - Tall, lean guy - went a size up - Super Happy with fit and priceUpdate:  8/1/16:  I ordered Jim the Navy blue - these came quickly - I washed right away and he wore immediately - Very happy with these pants again

These pants are exactly what I expected them to be considering the price I paid for them. They fit well and look really neat and professional. The only thing I don’t like about them is the pockets. The pockets on these pants are really shallow. You can’t fit a smartphone or anything else inside the pockets because the pockets aren’t deep enough. My iPhone and other objects have fallen out of my pockets while wearing these pants. Don’t put anything valuable inside of your pockets because it’s going to fall out and get lost.

I appreciate that these pants have a sufficiently long fly. So many work and casual pants these days are fitted with an annoyingly impractical short zipper. If you wear your pants near or just below your waist you have to fish your equipment up and over the jagged teeth of the fly to take a leak. Not so with these.

Definitely a retro color from the 50’s-60’s.I’d love this exact product in 100% cotton for summer wear.I wish they  were cut just a skosh fuller in the seat. I’m very pleased.

Good pants, classic fit, they haven't messed with them, unlike Levis and 501's. I ordered my usual size, they're about a half-inch small, but they stretch out a bit with wearing. Length is perfect. Should be very  comfortable when the sizing washes out.  I have two minor gripes: the front pockets would be easier to get into if they had more slash, and belt loops are too small for 11/2 inch ballistic belts -- I like the tunnel shape, though. I'll buy them again, might try one inch up next time.

I love wearing these for business-casual work pants.  They go great with a casual button up or polo shirt.  They fit me fine and I've had no issues with sizing in the waist or length.  I recently just bought another three pair and al fit fine. They seem a little stiff out of the packaging but they're actually very comfortable during the day. They wash great and almost never need ironing if cared for properly before and after washing.  The price is also great.  I've purchased khakis from warehouse clubs for the same price that initially seemed superior but eventually proved to be far less durable.  These Dickies can take rough treatment for those who aren't in the most clothes friendly professions.

Seem to sit very high on the waist

The pants seem like they would be very durable, with a coarse material that seems strong but maybe not the softest like khakis.  The one issue that caused me to return them is where the pants sit.  They sit at my belly button, which I did not see anywhere in the listing that they sat so high.  This may be the reason many reviews said that the pants feel tight. If they sat close to the hip I believe more people would find them comfortable.  Another issue I had is that the pockets seem smaller than normal pants, not leaving much room for a wallet or cell phone and still being able to walk comfortably.  I'll be trying another pair of dickies to seek a better fit for me.

Fit as expected
","
First off I'll say the fabric is much stiffer than I remember. I bought 2 pair almost 15 years ago and they're still going strong, but those are nice and soft now, so I'll have to attribute that to years of washing and drying. Hopefully the new pairs will also soften with age.The great part is that they fit exactly like my old pairs do, so I was happy about that. The size I bought was 34Wx32L and they fit as I expected.

First off I'll say the fabric is much stiffer than I remember. I bought 2 pair almost 15 years ago and they're still going strong, but those are nice and soft now, so I'll have to attribute that to years of washing and drying. Hopefully the new pairs will also soften with age.The great part is that they fit exactly like my old pairs do, so I was happy about that. The size I bought was 34Wx32L and they fit as I expected.

Excellent work pants, but verify fit before purchase
","
These are the same 874 standard work pants Dickies has made forever. Aside from being starchy as hell when new, taking a couple of wash cycles to loosen back up, they are still the best and most comfortable work pants you can get. They can even be worn casually and aren’t that unstylish. [Take anything *I* say about style with a huge grain of salt.]It should be noted that their work pants don’t seem to be sized the same way their jeans are. I had to return to Amazon two pairs of 874s that had tight waist measurement. Had to go from 36 to 38. This is why I only gave these 4 stars.

Then I canceled the pricier order and thought I was getting one pair of black pants and instead I got two pair of khaki ones. I paid for two pair also.

Classic affordable work pant
","
The most important thing to remember when ordering is to size up, as many reviews here indicate. These are classic work pants that have been around forever, and can be compared as far as longevity is concerned to the utilitarian Levi's 501. For example, my grandfather wore these daily. Not too tight or too baggy, always appropriate. Versatile enough to be used for manual labor or dressing up slightly. As others have noted, my only issue was the smell of these pants upon arrival. The only way I can describe the odour of these pants is as if they were constructed from fish food, pungent enough to be detected at a distance. Fortunately, this disappeared after the first wash. The only other issue is that unlike twill cotton chinos, these have a high polyester content, which results in a rigid plastic-like feel before breaking in. This is the tradeoff for durability at a low price.  If you're more concerned about looks (fit and material feel) over durability, 100% cotton chinos are a better option. But for this price-point the durability and versatility is hard to beat.

These are good pants, classic and durable. It comes out of the bag pretty stiff, it just needs to be broken into. A lot of people ran into some sizing problems and it is highly suggested you get a size larger than your waist size. Since the fabric has no stretch whatsoever, you need to at a minimum get a size that is exactly your waist measurements. However, if you want to actually be able to bend or sit in these, get a size or two larger. Remember, the size you choose is the size of the pants not the size of your waist.

Shallow pockets killed these pants.

The 874 Classics seemed like a bargain--great price and decent quality, but the front pockets are ridiculously shallow. They're so bad you have to take out your cell phone when you sit down so that it doesn't jab into your body. Not sure how this simple problem was never rectified. Maybe back when these pants were designed, most men only had two keys and a money clip. The pants are tight at the waist, too.

Good quality Dickies 874 work pants

I normally wear another national brand of work pants that fits my stout build better than the W or L brands. This is my first pair of Dickies and I'm quite pleased. Fabric for a twill is heavy (but not like the ""fire hose"" type) and should wear well, Belt loops are wide and they're located at the correct spots. I like the slip clasp at the waist versus a button. Zipper is robust & pockets are deep.

Great value; ordered a size up and they fit perfectly
","
These are an excellent value for the money for yard and house work. The material is neat looking but tough; it is a heavy weave but breathes and is suitable for 9-season use in Michigan. I have had low cost work pants with flimsy pockets that developed holes within a few months. The Dickies pockets seem durable, though I wish they were a touch deeper. The zipper-another area where some manufacturers skimp- also works smoothly and seems durable. After reading many reviews, I ordered an inch larger waist that my normal size of 32 and the pants fit perfectly; the inseam is true to size.  They are spacious but not baggy, and the 874 work pant sits comfortably high on the waste. I anticipate ordering an additional pair. Only complaints -- the single clasp closure is not terribly secure (wear a belt), the pockets could be a touch deeper, and I wish they had a dedicated cell phone pocket. But for what I paid (about $20 bucks) this is a 5-star purchase.

I loved these for my husband for a while, but now I know their sizing is off. I bought a size up. Unfortunately, the 36 and 38 are same width. There's no possible way my husband stretched out over an inch of fabric to equal the size difference. I work with textiles. Grab a towel or even a pair of your jeans in your house and see how far it stretches. Even with over time wear and tear material has a literal breaking point, before it gives or breaks down. More than an inch, is beyond a break point/wear show point. Even with reinforcement.

I bought 3 pairs of 30/29 pants and i definitely do not need any belts. These fit pretty tight from what im used to, so i would get 31 waist if you normally wear 30. I didnt care enough to send them back and wait another few weeks, because they do fit, im just not used to not wearing a belt and my pants staying up lol.

These pants run a size too small, got them for my husband for a one time occasion that he needed a blue color for. By the way, the royal blue color is very bright and is not a very flattering color in person IMO, but the pants served their purpose for the one night, then he gave them to our son who has no care whatsoever about fashion sense.

I have owned many pairs of Dickies throughout the years.  When I received this pair in the mail today, I noticed half of the hem on the bottom left leg came out.  The thread that had come undone was just hanging off the bottom.  Kind of disappointed but, I know these things happen.  Until now I have never had a problem with these Dickies pants, and still have two pairs that I have been wearing for over three years.  I will be ordering these again and hope for the best.

I have purchased many pairs of Dickies via Amazon without incident.  This pair of 874 work pants  arrived on time and the fit just as expected. The  durability is great as usual ; however, this time may have ruined my online Dickies shopping for good. The  smell radiating from these pants was horrendous.

Most american pants that I buy with a ""38"" inch waist in reality measure 39 and a smidge inches. These 38 waist pants are prety much exactly 38 inches, which makes them impossibly tight on me.

As you can see the zipper was not properly sewn and the pants cannot be worn without letting in a breeze.I am frustrated because I have bought many of these pants over the years (likely over 50 total) and a few years ago I had a great number of pants that had the zippers fail long before the pants were worn out.  I just dealt with it and often did my best to repair the zipper.  Sometimes I just sewed the zipper together above the part that failed.  Now these are brand new.  Grrrrrr!!!

If not for the Dickies logo stitched on the hip pocket nobody would ever know the difference.Problem with buying these pants locally is that I can find them in only khaki or blue, and the latter won't cut it in the office.  Via Amazon I can order more colors; not that I care but the wife tells me it is important not to wear the exact same thing every day (like bluejeans and t-shirts??).Pants fit as expected.  They are durable, hold up to years of wash-and-wear, and come in a wide range of colors.  Good to find a quality product that won't go out of production next year because a new model comes along.  Good and dependable...not unlike a pair of bluejeans.

I truly love the 874 Dickies work pants.  They are awesome and nearly indestructible.  They may not be the softest or the warmest pants, but they always look new, they never shrink, and they're available in a bunch of colors.  I have a pair for each day of the week; I only replace them about every 5 years.  With Dockers, I needed new ones after a year of regular use (and they cost a lot more).  Dickies last longer, look brand new for virtually the whole time, don't shrink over time, and cost less.  I will never buy another brand of work pants unless Dickies changes these.  I cut off the Dickies tag as I'm not a big fan of the orange; as long as you do this when they're first purchased, you'll never be able to tell the tag was there.  I wish the waist sat just a little lower on the waist, but that's a minor squabble given the overall quality and value.  These are also very consistent.  One size fit exactly the same in 4 different colors; that never happened with Dockers.

Great Quality, As Expected From Dickies. Fits Weird... Also As Expected From Dickies
","
The 874 Work Pant has probably been around since Feudal Times. If you're the one guy who's never owned a pair, here's what to expect:As far as quality and durability is concerned, these bad boys will probably be what the cockroaches are wearing after the nuclear apocalypse. It says to wash in cold and tumble dry medium, but you can throw these suckers in hot water and dry on hot and they'll still hold up for years. They don't really shrink, and I've never ever had a zipper break or button fall off a pair of 874's.Now for the bad, and ultimately why I recently switched from the 874's to the Dickies Slim/Straight for work. They fit fine at the waist and through the legs, but the seat is so frickin' baggy it looks like you're wearing a pair of jumbo Huggies with a full load. I can't speak for my fellow man who may be generously proportioned through the midsection and bottom, but for a tall H/W/P guy like myself, these things look downright ridiculous the way they billow and hang down in back.

I ordered the wrong size at first and had to utilize the free returns from Amazon and had them ship the correct size. That isn't on the pant itself though but on myself. Do yourself a favor and measure with a sewing or body tape measure before you order to get your measurements. You can also use a string and standard ruler.  I ordered based on what I was wearing for jeans and I found out that the size listed on my jeans is actually off from my actual waist size.The quality of the material is reason I wanted Dickies as well as hard to find white work pants which is what I need for my job.

High quality but the waist runs small

I have been wearing a 34-inch waist size for at least the past 30 or more years, but for these pants I had to order a 36-inch waist. I rated this ""fits as expected"" only because other reviewers warned about this issue, so I knew what size to order.This is one the few Dickies styles that is intended to have the waist band sit at the natural waist line. Many other Dickies styles, as well as several other brands, are intended to be worn somewhat lower than that, so for those the stated waist sizes can be even more misleading.The fabric is extremely stiff, but after after being washed once or twice, it's fine.For years I've been wearing the Roebucks brand pants that were sold by Sears until they were discontinued a few years ago. Except for needing a 2-inch larger waist size, I find these pants to be an almost perfect replacement for the Sears.

These pants look great and professional. I've had these pants for 3 months and haven't had to buy or replace a single pair yet. I will be buying these again when the time comes. In my job we use wooden pallets and I commonly brush against throughout the day, along with metal or wooden shelving. Before buying Dickies I would have to buy pants every week or two like clockwork. Buy these pants and save money in the long run. They are extremely cheap for the quality and comfort they provide. Great job Dickies! Also they came way before the time Amazon estimated delivery. Gotta love Amazon Prime.

Fred Costume Complete

Pants worked great for Fred Halloween costume. Only issue was the waist was majorly mis-sized. I am 31, ordered a 31, and when I measured the inside it was closer to a 29.  Had to order up to a 33 to get a normal fit. Took one star off for that, but left the rest because the pants otherwise were perfect, especially for my needs.

Sizes run very small - order two sizes up from normal
","
Four stars because the size is WAY off. Ordered 36 waist, fits more like a 33 or 34. Length is good. I had to return these and step up to a 38. The 38 fits like a 36. Other than that, these are great work pants. Note that if you order shorts, the waist seems to be more accurate! I ordered shorts two sizes to big, and they were, you guessed it, two sizes too big! Get it together, Dickies, and get your sizing on point! Other than sizes, material and construction seems to hold up to lots of shop abuse, and after a couple washes, are very comfortable. Very stiff at first.

I bought these for my hubby to work in. We loved how dark and rich the black color was.

The pants were not comfortable at all and were very restricting when he walked or bent down in them.

I have purchased three pair of these pants.  I love the way they feel and they are perfect for the office as I am handling items such as printers, computers, and other IT related stuff all day.  They have not let me down once.  They do not hold stains and the color I have easily hides dirt and marks that get on during the day.  The pants are perfect length, and fit almost perfect in the waist.  The first pair I ordered was the same size I get now, 40x34 but I could not even begin to get them buttoned around me, they felt like 32x34.  I sent them back and the second pair was good.  The first pair did have a size marking of 40x34 as well.  I will get more pairs of these.  They are not to thick, not to thin, and are my go to casual or daily pant for summer, fall, and spring wear but they can be a tad chilly in cold weather.

Love the pants, just wish that the pockets were a little wider/deeper.They should also ditch the little logo above the wallet pocket.These are very wrinkle resistant.  If I take them out of the drier and fold or hang them neatly, they don't need to be ironed.If you have sensitive skin, these will feel pretty rough. My wife doesn't understand why I like them since she says they are very tough material.I like them because the look very nice and don't pick up dirt, the fabric holds its shape perfectly, and they hold their color very well.Still look new even after wearing a dozen times.

I just wanted to let people know to order 2 sizes larger for waist size. I did read the reviews before saying this, as well as others saying that Americans are fat and other brands size too big.

Now, I am taking a new class that requires navy blue pants all semester, so I ordered a size 32, and they fit normally like all my other size 30 and 29 pants do. I would order 2 sizes bigger than what you usually wear as 1 size bigger will probably still be tight around the waiste.

We use Dickies at my fire department (for those of you that work in the fire service, you may know the pain of paying hundreds of dollars for ""better"" brands of pants that do the same job). I love Dickies pants for work. They are easy to care for and the material holds up well. With any type of dark clothing, you will experience fading over the long run, but again, as to be expected. One saying about Dickies in regards to size: ""Dickies don't lie!"" I, however, find this to be incorrect. I am slightly above a size 36 waist and am most comfortable in a Dickies size 40. Just something to consider. If you can, go try on a pair of Dickies at Target or Walmart before buying.

What’s Happened to Dickies Quality?

Replaced 3 other pairs of Dickies 874 Originals that I used almost daily for 2+ years.Now the VERY disappointing results. Only opened 1 of the 3 new pants, washed in warm/cold and hung to dry. The next day after pants are dry, I put them in warm drier with damp towel and fluff 20 mins to smooth out wrinkles (exactly same process as prior 3 pairs).These new pants have actually become baggy in the waste yet shrunk an inch in pant length. So now they won’t stay up with a belt and look like “flood pants”. Unacceptable!!Would like to exchange for 3 replacement pairs but time window has passed and don’t think Amazon will do that now.

These pants are nice, especially for the money.  Obviously pants are not easy to buy without trying on but given the low price I decided to go for it.  I am built a little thick and usually wear 38x30 and occasionally 40x30. I decided to go for the 38 and they are snug around the butt/upper thigh.  Usually when pants are tight on me it is the lower thigh so I was a little surprised.  They do fit but if you are torn between two sizes go for the larger one.  Probably a good thing to motivate me to lose a couple pounds.  They do look sharp and I wear them to work as business casual all of the time.

Pros.: Pants are long, came unhemmed, 7 beltloops, you can tell they will last...Cons: Not many colors to choose from at my height (6'7"" all legs), pockets shallow, run small (got 38/39 and fit tight around my waist), very stiff, as they'll take many washes to soften up...All in all, the pants are made to work in...

I have to wear black or khaki pants to work, and being a cat owner I can't really go with black. Despite the dress code I handle some pretty gross stuff, and I've ruined almost every pair of khakis I own. These work pants are the answer. They look just like ""real"" dress pants, but they're heavy material and they've got some sort of anti-liquid/anti-stain treatment on them. Water just beads off, solid stuff just wipes off or washes out without staining.My only gripes, and both minor:1: The fly isn't a button, it's a sort of tab/loop thing. Sometimes it comes unhooked. I always wear a belt anyway, so this isn't a huge problem.2: The side pockets could be a lot deeper. There is a shower of change whenever I sit down, but so far I haven't managed to lose my car keys.I think I'm going to end up buying a ton of these.

Waist was a touch tighter than I expected.
","
This is my second purchase of Dickies work pants in the past 12 mos. The first pair was a different cut but the same color, size, and material blend. I wanted to explore the different cut options to see which one works best for me. This pair's 40"" waist feels noticeably tighter than my other pair. However the material -- while still a 40/60 poly blend like my other pair -- feels MUCH itchier. I washed them twice and then ran them through 5 loads of drying laundry in succession (trying to beat some softness into them) and they still feel itchy and stiff. Reminds me of the company-issued work pants that I had to wear working for a major auto parts chain.

Reminds me of the company-issued work pants that I had to wear working for a major auto parts chain.

Stinky dead fish smell on the pants!  Nasty
","
The product was as described and fits perfectly.  We really like them.  Problem is, after opening the box and opening both pair from the plastic they were sealed in, We noticed a very offensive odor.  It smells like they were wrapped in dead and rotted fish.  Not sure if we're going to keep them if we can't get the smell out.  My son definitely can't wear them to school without at least a couple washings.  I've never had this issue before and was very dissapointed.

I've worn Dickies for over 20 years, they are absolutely my favorite pants. However, as other reviewers have mentioned, their sizes have become inconsistent as of late. I've had a pair of 33"" w x 31"" l slacks for several years that have fit perfectly. However, I ordered a new pair this year, exact same dimensions, and it's a good half inch longer! I had to go back and order a 30"" length just to get close to size I actually wanted. Not cool guys.

Wow. Ive never been more dissapointed in a piece of clothing. First, the waist runs a touch small fresh out of the bag. Probably .5-1” under advertised size. Next the material is almost stiff enough they could stand up on their own. Lastly, with how they sit on your waste, there ia FAR too little crotch room.God forbid you wash these and put them in a dryer. My 38” waist paints which were already borderline, are less than a 34” measured waist after one standard 45 minute dry cycle. FOUR INCHES of waist shrinkage in one dry cycle. The most unbelievable thing I've ever seen. Not to mentioned they're still WAY too stiff after washing with fabric softener. Would never recommend these

Also keep the $6.60 that I just spent to ship them, it’s the last $6.60 Dickies will ever get from me again!! I’m done doing business with your company.

It's really a 34!

I'm used to pant sizes being generous.. to a fault.  I've been led to believe that I really have a 34-inch waist (193 lbs, 5'11"").  Leave it to Dickies to slam some harsh reality into my bloated ego.  These are tight compared to my other ""34-inch"" pants.  Wearable, but tight. and butt tight, btw.  They sit high on the waist and give me cleavage where I probably don't want it.  They seem well-made and durable.  Time will tell.

Durable. Somewhat comfortable.

Blue collar jobs require some comfort level. I have an average build and this pant fits me well in all sorts of positions. Whether squatting to pick up a heavy object or climbing across blocked off areas to get merchandise, this pant gives me ample room. If you have thicker thighs, that might be a problem. After 10+ washes, it's still rough. I don't mind though. I normally wear a 30 L and it should be fine but this one seems to ride up on the back of the shoe. It didn't shrink or anything after the washes but it just needs a tug to get it back down after going up stairs. Maybe I'll get the 31 L next time. The waist was fine. Big plus is that my sweat doesn't show through under the waist line for some reason. That's good because w/ my old pants, once the sweat dried, it would leave a white residue on my backside.

For the price, being a well known brand, they are very well constructed pants made of a durable material. I have no doubt they will last me many years.Now for the particulars. First a little background on me. I'm a bit of a bigger guy with a few extra pounds  around the middle, thus the reason for buying my pants in the size I do.  While I, technically, have only a 31"" inseam, I get 32's so that when I put them on, I don't end up looking like I'm wearing high-waters.As to the length, they seem to fit the same as any other pair of pants or jeans I own. As for the waist, that's a different story. Unlike the 2 big names in jeans, Levi's and Wrangler's, who also make ""pants"", these particular pants run a little on the small side.  More like I'm trying to squeeze into my old 34's.Regarding the overall fit, unlike the affore mentioned Wrangler's that contain enough material to make a second pair of pants, these fit more like a good pair of Levi's.  That is, they don't give the appearance of sporting a sail or parachute when wearing them.  On a similar note, they are not as ""form fitting"" as the Levi's. However, they DO ride much closer to the leg than that other brand, making them an overall good looking, mostly comfortable pair of pants.

Well, when they were delivered, I tried them on and naturally I assumed that I gained back some weight, but, I found that was NOT the case. I saved the tags that were on the pants and I really don't know what to do. should I return them or wait until I loose some more weight.

everything I expected came to be EXCEPT the waist! just a LITTLE small.

I'm lucky in that I work out quite a lot, I'm tall and nicely proportioned. As a result my body is generally a good fit for many clothes. That's also true of these pants, which I purchased in two colors, both of which fit identically (that's a good sign of quality manufacturing).Downside is that the pants are designed to for at the natural waist, which is basically to say way the heck up there. These sit at least two inches higher up than any pair of Dockers I've ever owned. The resulting look is not flattering. Wiggle them down and they eventually ride back up and get uncomfortable.If you like really long in the crotch pants, these are for you. The cut is a hair tight in the hips/butt on me, but that is likely due to weight work making my butt a little big for my waist size.

Dickes work pants are so worth the money

They fit perfect around the waist and length. I've bought Dickies for years and they are the best work pants. I love the permanent crease which makes you look professional without having to iron all the time. I also love that I just wash, dry and hang them up and they are ready to go for work. I see, other people say Dickies run small but this isn't true. If you actually measure them with a measuring tape they are right on the money. In my experience tryng to buy other dress pants made by other companies all the pants are much bigger than the actual size. I was so happy to get them at a really good price and free shipping. I got them delievered to me much earlier than the actul date I was given. Very satisfied with the whole transacton and will be ordering a couple more pairs soon.

Right size, But too Tight in the Seat, Crotch and Thigh
","
These seemed great when I opened them! Nice, durable material, well known manufacturer of great quality goods. What could go wrong? I've been a 30/30 since 1989. If anything, I've become smaller. With that said; It seems the proportions of these pants are WAY off. These pants fit like jeans in the eighties! The waist fit great. The length was good. But the seat, crotch and thigh were so tight I looked like Cheryl Tiegs!!!  If I went up to a 32, the waist would be way to big. The only thing I can assume is these were irregular.

Right size, But too Tight in the Seat, Crotch and Thigh
 
These seemed great when I opened them! Nice, durable material, well known manufacturer of great quality goods. What could go wrong? I've been a 30/30 since 1989. If anything, I've become smaller.

To start; I know my size. These pants were WAY too small in the waste. What would be a 31 in ANY other brand fit like a 28. These felt like getting into a really stiff and rigid cardboard box that was way too small. Because of this experience, I will avoid Dickies. It's a bummer, as I was very excited about these pants.

Good fit and price
","
These are my husband's favorite work pants. Local stores have stopped carrying them in anything close to his size (38/26) so we are very glad to see them here. A 38/30 was the closest to his size we could get. Fortunately I am able to hem them and not have to pay someone else for the alteration. However, if anyone else is shortening these (or other) pants, measure BOTH inseams, because I found there to be a half inch difference in the existing inseams on the same pant, so I had to shorten each leg a different amount to make the final inseams match. Would have been five stars plus if they had them in a 26"" or 27"" inseam to begin with--I know there are lots of other guys out there with the same issue.

I'm a mechanical engineer and as part of my job I find myself inspecting components out in the shop from time to time.  These pants are very good quality and are very stain resistant.  I agree with other people who said that these pants run slightly smaller then other brands of pants.  For instance, I normally wear a 34x30 but for these I consistently need to get a 36x30.  That being said, the fit of the 36x30 is consistent every time I order a pair, so once you find your size you can order that size and feel confident it'll fit.  For the price you can't beat these work pants.

Most customers should order at least one size larger in the waist.

Thank you to all the other reviewers for warning me about size. I typically take a 38/34 pant to get a loose, comfortable fit. Heading the warnings I bought these Dickie's work pants in a size 40 waist and they fit perfectly, even slightly snug. I can't imagine trying to get on a size smaller and expecting them to be comfortable on an 8-10 hour workday.The length seems exactly correct but buyers should definitely order a size or two larger in the waist.Other than that, I've yet to break them in so the material is a little stiff but not uncomfortable and the metal clasp is definitely better befitting my work uniform than a button. I think I'll own these for a long time.

I labled this as ""somewhat large"" only because I didn't know my husbands length/inseam but I knew his waist size so I ordered the longest inseam available and they ended up being almost 5 inches too long. But it's better than too short because all we did is go to the tailor and have her take them in and they fit him perfectly. I'm only giving it a 4 because he haaaates the slip/clip closure on the pants instead of a normal button. But the pants themselves are great, fit great, look great, I'm hoping they will hold their color since they will be washed at least 3 times a week due to his work.

This was all while wearing the pants because I couldn't loosen the belt to take them off!  Very awkward to do.

So, when I'm cutting the fields, working on trails or mending fences, nothing sticks to them. Once in a while you'll get grass on them from the mower, but a quick and easy brush with the hand and any residue comes right off.I definitely recommend these for any heavy duty yard, gardening, farm or cabin work.

Great pants for work. I pair these dark navy Dickies pants with a navy blue suit jacket and I'm good to go at work, I'm a fire safety director so wearing durable clothes and gear is a must. Now the not so good, Dickies pants are about two inches too small in the waist, I usually wear a 34 waist but they were too tight actually causing lower back aches, I ordered a size 36 waist and now all is good, I wish Dickies were more true to size!

These pants are a rugged, somewhat rough duck fabric.  They are not a smooth twill texture (like Dockers). My husband can wear them to his workplace and look crisp and presentable, however. They wash well and maintain a crisp surface. The pockets are not enormous but will be ok for the average guy. He ordered the maroon pants.  The color is very nice, not garish. It has not faded through repeated washings. I think these are an excellent value.  They seem to be cut to fit closely to the body, so if you are chubby, you might want to buy bigger rather than smaller.

These pants are great. I work at Whataburger and it gets quite hot when I work the grill, these keep me cool compared to the nasty black denim I  had to wear because I couldn't find my size in-store. But the price was cheaper online even with shipping. I bought two pairs of them for 36 bucks with free shipping that was super quick. If I would have bought them in-store i would have spent $50 on two pairs plus the 10% tax in my state. One thing that i did notice is that they need to be broken in and washed before you use them because they are super stiff when you get them. Overall i see them lasting a very long time and they are super comfortable. Definitely recommend.P.S. - if you work in fast food like i do, they don't hold that nasty grease smell after washing which is a plus in my opinion.

Economy Work Pants, Scratchy Material, Not Very Comfortable
","
I used to wear these for BOH cooking and FOH serving. They look way more professional than black baggy chef pants but are also not as comfortable to wear. Really poor quality linen is used in these pants; it's a very scratchy, stiff, dry material and will tear in the crotch area over time (happened to my last 2 pairs). Always buy a size up or two, they ride really high on your stomach unlike most pants. The waist is by no means stretchy so it may be way uncomfortable for larger people.

I used to wear these for BOH cooking and FOH serving. They look way more professional than black baggy chef pants but are also not as comfortable to wear. Really poor quality linen is used in these pants; it's a very scratchy, stiff, dry material and will tear in the crotch area over time (happened to my last 2 pairs). Always buy a size up or two, they ride really high on your stomach unlike most pants. The waist is by no means stretchy so it may be way uncomfortable for larger people.

Great quality and stitching.

As far as fitment goes, I highly suggest trying them on at a store beforehand. I am a 34 Waist and 30 inseam in these pants. In casual jeans I am a 30-31 Waist and 32 inseam.The quality of the material and stitching is second to none for the workplace. They don't fall apart like some jeans and work pants.Being completely honest, the fitment isn't the greatest on me, but for the price and quality of material, I am willing to live with them. I actually bought 10 sets in assorted colors.Before anyone asks, they are made in Honduras.

Always try Dickies on before you buy.
","
I love Dickies work pants and will continue to purchase them in the future. That being said, don't buy them online. Their sizing is way too inconsistent to trust you'll get the right fit. Even when purchasing in a store, try on every pair. Don't trust the labels, or even your own knowledge of what size you wear. I just returned two pairs bought from Amazon for being way too small for the size listed on the tags, and they are not even consistent with each other. I knew better from my years of wearing Dickies but tried it anyway. As easy as the return process is with Amazon, it isn't worth the inconvenience.

They are stiff when you get them but just wash them a couple of times and they are fine. Yes Dickies do shrink a bit so I do suggest you buy a size larger and mostly air dry. This style works great for my job. They are durable and don't fade after a few washings. As long as you get the right measurements you really can't go wrong with this style of pants.

I work with Baptist Disaster Relief, often cleaning up after devastating wild fires.  A few years ago we worked one such fire in Bastrop, Texas in the area of one of Dickies' manufacturing facilities.  The Dickies people expressed their appreciation for our efforts by giving each of us several pairs of work pants.  I not only wear these pants for work, but also for most casual and even some semi-dressy affairs.  They are comfortable, durable and look sharp.  I ordered this pair because I needed a black pair since that color was not among those that Dickies gave to us.

GREAT PANTS! Run a size small in the waist.

Luckily I have lost some weight, because the 36's are really more like 34's. The way US sizes work (thanks to us being so fat and self-conscious) is that sizes are actually one size big. i.e. size 34 is usually about 36 inches.So by that standard, these pants are pretty true to size. If you are used to typical American sizes, go a size up on these puppies.The pants are nice, heavy material, seem to be very wrinkle resistant.The ""Original"" fit is pretty loose in the legs for me. Looks like the picture.

My husband definitely wears the pants in the family. There is no better pants he'd rather wear than these! My husband loves these pants. Since buying them I have bought a few more pairs. He won't wear anything else to work! He says they are the most comfortable breathable pants that able him to move around freely when climbing around in boats, up racks, stairs, and where ever else he may need to squeeze into. He won't leave home without them.

Durable, look good, good price but buy them one size larger
","
I read other comments about these saying that the sizing runs small, so I ordered one size larger than I normally wear. They JUST fit with no room to spare. That said, these are an excellent value. The price is very good, and they are very durable (almost like denim). These are work pants for a plumber or mechanic that also easily pass as casual office/business attire. I wear them in an office--but I carefully cut off the little logo patch. I'll buy these again.

Great pants - beware of color selection

Dickies Men's Original 874 is a great multi-use pants.  They wear forever; they clean up like a dream; they hold their press well; and I find them comfortable to wear.  I wear them for work, wear them for everyday wear and even wear them with a sport jacket.At the time I purchased this pair labeled Stone, the Amazon.com product description photo was reversed with the color for the Khaki pants.  I ordered the Stone colored pants since the description showed the darker khaki color that I wanted.  Sure enough, the pants came in the light tan color.  So I ordered the Khaki version with the photo of the light colored pants.  They came in the dark khaki.  If you want khaki, order Khaki.  I hope Amazon.com corrects the photo switching error.

This is a repeat purchase. These are roomy enough to be comfortable work pants without looking sloppy. It is nice to be able to buy a size 33 waist, so they feel just right.

Bought 3 pair.  One was larger than the other two, but by the time my husband told me the window to return them was gone.

They were marked for the size I ordered, but they were really baggie in the legs and around the waist.

Way too small. Too tight.

We ordered two pairs of Dickies pants. This one and a loose fit version. They were both the exact same size 34-32. These were so tight I couldn't even button them. The others fit perfect and as expected. That's all I have to say about that. In my opinion, see these for a better fit: Dickies Men's Loose Fit Double Knee Twill Work Pant, Black, 34W x 32L

Watch that Waist!

The fabric seems durable.  Only time will tell if the color fades with washing.  The length was fine, but the waist is tight - and a 40 waist is fine for me in most pants.  I'd suggest considering going up a size if you purchase these pants.

The pants themselves seemed to be good quality and fit great down the leg. The problem was the waist fit. These pants ride way too high—coming up to the naval, which I thought was odd for Mens clothing. The band has no stretch whatsoever so I was forced to return them. I don’t consider myself “fat”, but my stomach is wider around than my waist. Beware the fit! Measure around your stomach for the waist size and you should be good to go, assuming you like high-riding clothing.

Best Business Casual/Work Pants

Needed business casual pants but had already been looking for alternatives to sta-press and knew I already liked the Dickies brand. I need 36x28 as we all know Dickies runs a bit tight and my thighs need a bit more room. These fit perfectly and made the wife check me out with my Fred Perry on. Was a bit darker than I expected and thought I got a black pair but in the ight you tell the difference easily enough. Will buy again.

What a pleasure after wearing linen supply trousers! Ordered 32x32 from a major linen supply and trousers actually measured 34x30 in spite of being marked 32x32! These are meant to sit at natural waist. If you are being silly, your results will vary. These Dickies are actually the size that they claim to be. Measure twice and THEN order these excellent trousers. Great quality, as always, and arrived quickly.

These were way too stiff to wear. I thought they would be more like Khahki's but they were stiff to the point of being like Slacks or maybe Chinos. I did not like them, but that does not necessarily make them bad.

Nice for work.

I am glad that I read the reviews before ordering. They run small. I wear a 36'W, ordered a 38 and they fit. Length is true. The rest of the fit is loose enough for squatting, bending and kneeling, IE work pants. They look good enough for business casual when needed. They are 65% poly and 35% cotton. There is enough cotton for comfort (breath-ability), and the poly keeps them wrinkle free right out of the dryer.I am in the appliance business, and prefer these over jeans when working. However, I do not think they will be warm enough when temps drop in to the 30's or less, hence 4 stars. Maybe I will try some light long underwear so I can use them for winter rather than go back to the jeans. A good value at this price. I reordered, and now own 6 pairs.

Perfect Pants!

First off, sizing: As other reviews have stated, order the next size up from your true waist measurement. I typically wear a 34x32 pant, but I wear a 36x32 in these Dickies pants. Inseam is true to size.That being said, these are by far the best value out there for casual or work pants. Yeah, they're synthetic material, but they don't feel like it once broken in a little. I wear these instead of typical khakis since they will last an unbelievably long time, and they look far better than any pair of pants from a department store. Dickies really hit a home run with the cut of these pants. Roomy pockets and wide belt loops are nice touches. What I like best about these pants is the fit. It really is a classic, traditional fit. They sit at the waist, where pants belong, instead of down around your hips like 95% of pants and jeans these days, which makes them remarkably comfortable. There is plenty of room in the front and the seat for your anatomicals to rest comfortably without scrunching, wedging, or making you look like you're wearing balloony dad jeans. Honestly, I don't think a tailor could make any other pair of pants look as good as these. My wife says my butt looks amazing in them. The best part is that I can go from wearing these with a blazer to crawling under my car to work on it, if I really felt like it, without worrying about ruining the pants -- Wonderful!I've decided to forego the retail stores completely from now on and stick to these Dickies whenever I'm not wearing jeans. So far, I have them in Charcoal, Navy, Khaki Tan, and Silver Gray, and I plan on getting more. And why not, for 20 measly bucks?!

Good pants - wrinkle free - check sizes

I give it 5 stars because my son refuse to wear anything else but Dickie's to work, also they hold up through many washes.  The fitting is different than his other clothes, we have had to play around with the Dickie styles & sizes, finally the 874 Original at 30W x 31L.  He wears 29W x 32L jeans and khaki's.  These are higher waist pants, I am sure that plays a role but when we bought his normal length it was way too long, hence the 31L worked perfectly.  Also, the rear is baggier than we want, he is medium to slender build.  Hope this helps!

High Quality Pants, Low Quality Fit
","
I bought these pants because I previously had purchased the same pant in 42x32 and they were a bit long so I hemmed them.  On this pair (42x30) the waist was much tighter than the 42x32 pair that I bought even being listed as the same waist size.As far as the material goes I couldn't recommend them more.  I work in the copier repair industry and thus get toner, grease and oils on me on a daily basis.  These pants shed liquids very well and don't take to holding toner like normal khakis work pants, etc.  They are very durable as I'm getting down on the ground a lot and they still look like brand new.  I will probably buy these pants forever unless they stop making them, but I'll be buying them in a store where I can try them on since the waistline isn't consistent in size.

Durable, affordable, but just a tad short... awesome nonetheless.

I own two of these pants, one in charcoal and the other in brown. I've been wearing both consistently since this past summer and am quite happy with them.I like these pants because they're very durable, stain-resistant, and rarely ever need ironing. If they do happen to need a press, it'll only take a couple minutes and you're good to go. Don't forget to cool iron otherwise you might end up burning your pants!My only gripe is that these pants seem to run just a tad shorter than most pants this size. For me, 32x32 is just a smidge shorter than I'd like and the 32x34 is too long. I don't know if this is just a ""me"" problem or of others have had a similar experience.Regardless, the pros far outweigh the minor con. I'm definitely sold on these pants.

I am a 34 waist and, from my previous experiences with these pants, bought a 36 (as I usually do in these pants). This was the tightest pair of 36 waist pants I have worn. There was hardly any room to ""buckle"" the little metal clip in the front. Not sure if Dickies is changing their sizing, but these seem to run even smaller than before. I suggest you buy 2 sizes larger than you normally would. I wear a 34 in most pants, but in a very few I have to go 36, these I would have to go 38. I have worn these pants for 8 years and this is the first time I've experienced such a sizing issue.

These used to be nice work pants that were durable, comfortable, functional and good looking. Now the fabric is stiff as a board yet the ""permanent"" crease is mostly gone after the third wash (all 3 pair). Reviewers have complained about the tiny front pockets for quite a while but Dickies has done nothing to address those complaints. The front pockets are still way too small, although they used to be normal size. I'll be looking for a new brand of work pants.

These used to be nice work pants that were durable, comfortable, functional and good looking. Now the fabric is stiff as a board yet the ""permanent"" crease is mostly gone after the third wash (all 3 pair). Reviewers have complained about the tiny front pockets for quite a while but Dickies has done nothing to address those complaints. The front pockets are still way too small, although they used to be normal size. I'll be looking for a new brand of work pants.

Great tough work pants,and stylish too, I think, but a little tight in the crotch to be honest. Seriously though these pants are tough wore a pair through a year of work at a pizza place where they saw a surprising amount of chemicals and grease stains that cleaned out very well. The cloth at the crotch however is starting to wear pretty thin which I attest to the slightly too tight feel but otherwise I'd recommend these for sure.

Pants run a little small but don't shrink. I was prepared for this and ordered appropriately. All is well in the sizing and fitting department. Most disappointing is color, though.

A little tight in the waist.

I've been wearing Dickies in the same size for the last 10 years or so. For some reason the clasp was over about an inch farther than every other pair of Dickies I have ever worn, making these pants  a little tight to fit into. I'm not sure if it's an amazon thing or I just got a bad pair. I recently lost about 10 lbs so they fit fine now but for the first 6 months of wearing these pants I had to alternate between having them clasped and unclasped. Just beware if you are really close to needing a bigger size these might be too small.

The length is fine and they indeed do rest at my waist
","
I bought these because they came in a 29 inch inseam and the claimed to have a waist band that sits at your true waist. The length is fine and they indeed do rest at my waist. The problem is the the rise is wrong (the length of fabric from waist to crotch). I feel like I'm advertise the fact that I am a male, there is not enough room and I'm pulling at the rear to get the seam out of my crack. My other complaint is, they came out of the bag with an unpleasant smell, stiff and scratchy. After 2 washings they still show the packing creases and have softened a bit. Fix the rise and abandon whatever your putting on the fabric before packaging and you'll have a decent pair of pants.

From size 38-44 waist, length of leg increases dramatically. 38w leg fits great. 40w, mind you my legs have not grown , leg a little too long. 42w legs very long. 44w! Legs need tailored to size by professional seamstress. You can’t just hem them ‘cause you get bell bottom look. But this is every pair I try on. Dress casual jeans khaki and yes work.

These are my daily wear pants. Durable, comfortable, and professional-looking.As for sizing, be aware that these fit like old school dress slacks: above the hips / on the waist. If you want them to ride lower like most modern jeans, try a wider waist with a shorter length. If you've got a bit of a belly, you may have to play around with the sizing a bit.

The pants arrived on the day expected and I followed the advice of others who said they run small so order a size larger and that's what I did. I always read the suggestions of others who have already purchased a product for helpfulness. They fit fine and now I have a comfortable pair to be casual. It's great to avoid the stores in search of clothes if only buying one or two articles. Thanks to Amazon and others for suggestions.

Great pants all around

Great pants all around, I wear them to work, casually, and formally. Dickies definitely last longer than any pair of jeans I have owned. Sure they are stiff the first couple times worn but simply wash and dry a few times and they are very very comfortable. Wearing a pair of tan dickies originals as I type this, they are the softest most comfortable pair that I own. I will never buy dickies in-store again because they never have my size 33x34 (I'm tall and scrawny) and they do not have nearly the variety. Worked in a dairy dept at a grocery store 9yrs through high school and college and I never wore anything but Dickies. Because they last.

They wash up nice and hold a crease when put on a hanger right out of the dryer.I have been wearing Hagger everywhere khakis for 5 years now ,but the material starts to get worn out from machine washing very easily! I will post more about the wear of these 874 pants in a month when i see how these hold up after about 30 washings!

May be snug, but fantastic quality.

I bought these for my son for his new job.  He bought a pair in his normal size a retail store and said they were a little small/tight.  So I went online and we bought one size up and he said they are much more comfortable.  I don't know if they are normally a snug pant or not, but going one size up for him worked better.  The quality of the material is superb!  Would definitely recommend.

I do like dickies, I've spilt oil, gas, other miscellaneous chemicals with no problems or bleaching. The worse chemical I've spilt on my dickies was battery acid. No holes or bleaching from it. My cotton shirts I've worn at the same time have so many holes I was shocked my shorts looked just fine. So for working dickies is my choice and the choice for a lot of other mechanics out there.

Next time, I'm ordering 36""x32"" (my actual size) in Khaki and Navy.Other than that, everything you hear about Dickies is true. Stiff at first, but becomes softer the more you wash it.

I am very happy with these dickies pants. So happy in fact I bought a total of 6 pairs in various colors. I had to order 5 of them from the dickies website to get my size 31x34 in all of them. I bought these to skateboard in and wear around the house or wherever when I'm not at work. My normal jeans that I wear are very expensive and loose fitting throughout the legs so they start to tear at the bottom from skateboarding. These dickies are much slimmer throughout the legs than I usually wear but I have gotten use to them. They are holding up well and look kind of cool. The are plain but still in a nice way they have sort of a dressy look to them.

Ok. So my entire closet has size 30W pants, literally EVERY single pair. So obviously I bought the 30W on here. Thought it would fit snugly like all my other pants but this one was incredibly tight, I thought this has to be 29W or 28W but no, it said 30W right there on the label. So either my entire collection of legwear is mislabeled or Dickies made it too tight for what it's measured for.

Awesome.  The fabric is sturdy, but not overbearing.  It stretches, both at the butt/waist and at the thigh/knee.  The only downside I have is the giant 'Dickie's' patch at the back-side.  For me, a black Sharpie marker fixed that.  A great work pant for chefs/food servers, etc - the buttons and zippers are all black.

Awesome.  The fabric is sturdy, but not overbearing.  It stretches, both at the butt/waist and at the thigh/knee.  The only downside I have is the giant 'Dickie's' patch at the back-side.  For me, a black Sharpie marker fixed that.  A great work pant for chefs/food servers, etc - the buttons and zippers are all black.

I had to purchase these to meet the dress code of my new workplace.

They may have an annoying hook instead of a button, but I've found the pants don't soak up water! Wearing jeans while dish washing was a drag because it wouldn't take long before they became so soaked that it felt like I was wearing wet towels on my legs. The water just runs right off these pants though, and any wetness dries very quickly.In my particular situation, these pants were a better investment than I initially thought -- I actually want to wear them to work, now!

It may just be the style of the pants. Otherwise I love these pants, and will certainly be buying more in the future!

Good Quality

Bought these for my husband and they fit very nice. I will say they are high wasted - more like a suit pant than a jean fit. He is in between a size 33 and 34 waste, and knowing Dickies normally run on the slim side, I went with the 34. Which ended up being what he needed for his ""bubble butt"" to fit.

I usually wear a 34x30. After reading the reviews I figured going up to a 38 would be a safe bet.  So I ordered 3 pairs of pants 2 sizes bigger.  One pair was tight on me when I wore them,  the second fit my waist but doesn't have any room for the important pieces when I sit down,  and I couldn't even button the 3rd. This was before I even washed them.  These were pants that are 2 sizes above what I normally comfortably wear.

Professional, durable and inexpensive.  Dickies pants are essential for the business casual look without the worry of tearing. I have brought the 874 work pant from the office and to the field; these pants are equally suited  for either role.  Like all true work pants, there is a level stiffness inherent in them.  But after several washings they pants will soften significantly and become as comfortable as any cotton jeans.Be aware that the 874 is not vanity sized like many other pants from different manufacturers.  These are true sizes and may fit tighter than what you would expect.

Pants go great with my Hawaiian shirts and ukulele

Got it and it fits as expected, as long as I don't gain more weight I should be okay (another incentive to not get lazy and binge eat while playing couch potato). Since they are actually work pants I think they are very well made, will last longer and function better than another white pair of pants I got which were somewhat flimsy and starting to fray a bit.

Sturdy material but deceiving size!

The pants feel a size or two too small even though it's the same size I buy for all my other pants. The material of the pants do feel like they will last a long time. The thigh area feels too snug and the zipper will not go up, but I can button it up just fine. When you do walk it sounds like sandpaper. Haha. 4 stars because it feels sturdy like advertised but the size marketed is deceiving. If you feel you have big thighs, do yourself a favor and order a size or two higher. I should have read the reviews before ordering!

These Dickies Work Pants were as expected.  They fit as a 38 x 30 was expected to fit.  No problems.

These pants were purchased for my daughter to wear at her job.  They fit okay even though they are men's pants, but I definitely recommend a belt.  Next time, we may look for a reinforced thigh for her pants, as there has been wear in the thigh area.

If these are the pants you must have, then buy them a couple of sizes larger.  I'm a 36inch waist, so I bought a 38 per the other reviews.

The pants themselves are great as far as being Dickies. I think Amazon has the wrong sizing. I tried the same waist size at a brick and mortar retail store and they fit perfect.

I was disappointed to find that they were too tight on the waist. I'd say if you buy these, get a size larger.

Good: Love the material and the sturdiness of the pockets.Bad: These things are tight on me, especially around the thighs and waist. I'm not sure if wearing these for a bit will loosen them up a bit but if it does these pants will be fantastic. I'd advise people to get a size larger than what they usually get.

I had bought another pair of Dickies ""work pants"" that were decent enough to wear in an office environment but also durable, and I guess I got the wrong number.

Always like Dickies stuff...
","
I lost weight, so ordered these, a size (2 inches) smaller than my last pair. Now I will say that Dickies pants run small. My waist was about 42 when I ordered the 44's. Now my waist is about 39 or 40, and these 42's fit fine. The only reason I'm not giving these pants five stars is that one of my last pair, having only been worn a few times, lost the zipper pull when unzipping them. I mean it came right off in my hand and now I can't find it of course and don't know how to fix it, or if it can even be fixed, or if it's worth what it would cost to have someone fix it. It's the first time this has happened. It did NOT happen with this particular blue pair, yet. Hopefully it will not. I love these pants in general for many reasons, not the least of which is the fact that they are kind of stain proof and even slightly water resistant. I did notice that these seemed too short, however, while the 44/32's I ordered in the past were too long. There is no option in between so next time I will order the 32 length as I can cuff them up, that is fine with me. UPDATE: I lost a lot more weight, and ordered a pair of 34/32's recently, which were called ""khaki"" as pictured above, and on some seller's sites that same color pictured was called ""desert sand"". The pair I received was not the light color pictured, it was a greenish tinged tan color, almost grey looking ""tan"" color. On some seller's sites they picture the color I received, calling it ""maple"" or ""washed maple"". In other photos ""maple"" is a more yellowish warm light brown. My point is, do NOT trust the photos on ANY of the sellers pages selling Dickie's work pants, at least when it comes to the tan/khaki colors. Black is black..(or is it?? haha). I kept them anyway, they are for work and it didn't matter but if you want a particular color of khaki, you better go buy it at an actual store.

Polyester Content Makes Them A Winner
","
My husband has had three pairs of Dickies for working out in the yard.  They wash like a dream and need no ironing.  They keep their crease.  Because of the polyester content, they retain their color wash after wash and the fabric does not wear out.  The first pair we bought years ago finally needed replacement because the zipper broke, but it took years for that to occur.

Because of the polyester content, they retain their color wash after wash and the fabric does not wear out.  The first pair we bought years ago finally needed replacement because the zipper broke, but it took years for that to occur.

Comfortable, High-quality work pants
","
I work in a restaurant, and coming in direct contact with oil is a daily chore. Because of the density and type of material, the oil rarely reaches my skin when wearing these pants. Contrary to what others wrote  the pants fit as expected, and even had a little ""stretch"" to them when checking my range of motion. Dickies have always been my go-to pants as a cook, contractor's apprentice, and because of the casual-dress look of the pants, can even be worn for (slightly) less-casual occasions. The washability of these compared to competitors is unmatched. Some of my ""off-brand"" work wear retains the smell of the restaurant indefinitely. These smell fresh after just one wash. As long as the quality remains true, I'm a customer for life.

I really don't want to keep them but with the trouble I had finding something long and slim enough I will keep them but will keep looking for more of a softer material, dress pant that is reasonable priced.

I wear these for yard work and rehabbing houses. Hold up much better than my normal Khakis. The waistband is uncomfortable until washed a few times, but it keeps your pants up when working. Only gripe is the front pockets could be deeper. Concealed carry users will be disappointed.They also look good enough when new that you could wear them for more than work situations. Fit true to size.

I've had 5 pairs of these pants for over 2 years.  I wear one pair each day of the work week.  I'm a Pest Control Technician and often find my self climbing on rooftops and sitting on them while doing exclusion work.  Before I wore Dickies, I'd wear normal dress pants which lasted a good one visit on top of a room before holes were forming.  The Dickies are tough, I've been on my knees and behind on roof tops and never had a hole.  I go under houses and have to crawl around in rocks and dirt but have yet to find a hole.  After two years of wearing these and washing repeatedly, they are finally starting to fade a little and start to get the fuzzies or ""Pilling"" on the fabric.  I also love the range of waist and length sizes.  If you're short and fat, you can get pants without hemming, if you're tall and skinny, they've got sizes for that frame also.  Its great.  If you do any sort of labor and need quality work pants, don't hesitate to order these.My only complaint is the fit, they always run a little small.  I have to buy one size up just to ensure they fit.  It's not flattering when you're picking your size but keep that in mind.Update: Its May 2017 and I still have these same pairs of pants I originally ordered. They each get worn/washed about once a week, a pair for each work day. I have a couple of pairs that are finally getting thin in the crotch from rubbing but no holes or tears anywhere.

My husband wears these to his office job. They are very well made and stand up to repeated washing with never any decline in the material or look of this product. I don't think that you can wear thses pants out any time soon. The price iwas great, Quck shipping too. The inseam of 31 is very hard to find, yet everything including that, all came in one great slack.

I absolutely LOVE Dickies work pants! Im a tall woman so it is nearly impossible to find long pants in stores. My local Walmart sells these pants but no lenths past 34. These pants are well worth the price because they can last 6 months or better. I will be purchasing more before the price increases.

The pants fit like every other pair of dickies i've purchased. These pants do not have the cell phone pocket. The only complaint I have is when i opened the packaged it smelled very bad.

Price Comfortable but Pant Isn't
","
I bought these Dickies for my son (his shop class requires them). The pants are made well and are a decent price!  However, my son says they're not comfortable. The rise is too high meaning the waist line fastens well above the belly button and the pant leg is about 2"" longer then the 36"" denoted on the pant. I can hem so it'll work for us. If you don't sew, don't buy these or be willing to pay for the alternations. There are other Dickies those styles are size accurate and comfortable. For my son's sake, I won't order the Original 874 again.

Not for me 874 I love my double knee dickies!!!
","
The dickies original 874 do not fit the same way as my dickies double knee ones do. I ordered the 874 because they do not have my waist or length even closely anymore on Amazon in the double knee so I figured I would try the 874, order the waist 2 sizes up, the shortest length Amazon had  in stock and hem them the rest myself. I have the Amazon store card and I needed a few new ones for my new job, they didn't like the bottoms frayed and not neat and clean so I ordered up these 874. My reasons I didn't like the 874 were: i don't like the clasp, it feels cheap n easy to bend, I didn't like how they sat on my waist, the pockets felt smaller then even my new double knee pants, I like the cell phone pocket I have the iPhone 6s with otterbox on it and the phone stays in my pocket as long as I don't put my butt to the ground while on my feet ( have a standing up job), and these were alittle tighter at my thighs.I have had the double knee ones 5 pairs now down to 4 in good work attire minus the bottoms being frayed since 2005 ( last pair is a mess around pair still wearable). Don't get me wrong they are stiff as hell for quite some time after wears n washings, the 874's I got from Amazon had the same feel to them new as my new double knee does. Takes at least 10 wears/washings to start a good break in. The stitch work at the seams is the same quality as its been for me for over 10 years now on both types.Like all dickies order at least one to two full sizes up the normal jeans/ work pants. Now if your dickies you have are extremely old before you buy a new pair I'd say go to anywhere that sells the exact style you want and try on a few sizes, find your waist size and then order em here. Dickies sizing has gotten alittle worse over the years and a little more unpredictable. Most places don't sell the bigger waist with short leg length in above size 36 waist in stock.  So if you at least get your waist size from a new pair of dickies and you know your length you'll be fine (length for me has always been true to its size).I washed my double knee every week, I was a mechanic and a cook for all my years of wearing them so they got dirty. Never got a hole, cut or button pop off, I would say based on having the 874 in my hand and feeling them they would be the same. being a female and woman's work pants back then were thin, light weight cheap products I loved my men's dickies, now they have women's ones out there that are okay but not the same as the men's. Lucky for me a local store did an exchange for me n I just paid the difference in price and got the pants I like better.

I own several Dickies pants and they all have one thing in common; They're comfortable!  They fit me perfectly since I know the size that fits me.  The interesting thing about them is they actually fit small, so I suggest you order a slightly bigger size to ensure they fit. For instance, my waist is a 32, if I ordered 32 they wouldn't fit, so I ordered a 34 which fits perfectly!

These pants are a true fit...stiff. I suggest washing them a couple times with softener before having to wear them for any length of time with lots of motion. Dickies are meant for physical labor while still looking professional. Got 3 pairs in Navy and couldn't be more pleased. Shouldn't need to worry about the work dress code for as long as the job holds...

Too Small But Not Giving Up.
","
I have tried to guess my ""Dickies"" size twice now to no avail. I have these exact pants at home but in their beige/khaki color and they are 30 x 30. They are a little snug so I thought I would go up a little to a 32 x 29 because I am also short. The pants that were delivered got here in a timely fashion and were PERFECT in length. The issue was the fact that I could not fit them around my waist. The felt like they were 28 or 29 in width. So I went up from there to 32 x 30 (fully aware that I was buying what may have been longer not wider pants) knowing that some companies do the numbers backwards. I do not know if that is the case with Dickies but the second pair came in two days and when I tried them on/ sure enough they were closer in the waist but still too snug for comfort. I would say they were maybe a big 29 or a small 30. I plan to keep trying so long as they are willing to keep sending. I will keep you all updated on my findings. So far, other then the size issue, returns and re orders have been smooth. This company seems very legit in their customer service. Once I find my size I plan to get a few more pairs in different colors.

My teenage son needs to wear khakis as part of his school uniform. I love how Dickies offers such a wide range of sizes. I used to hem his pants all the time because the ones that fit his waist were always too long. Not with this pair of pants. I measured my son and ordered according to the measurements and these pants fit him perfectly. I love the sturdy construction and stain resistant treatment. He loves the crease and thickness which give him the look he likes. We highly recommend these pants. While they cost a bit more than other khaki pants, especially those labeled ""school uniform"", the quality is worth the few extra dollars. Here on Amazon is where I found the best deal after thoroughly comparing prices.

The only other critique is that the front pockets could be a little deeper.  Otherwise, I like the pants and they meet my needs very well.

These are like dress pants in more industrial disguise
","
The build quality of Dickies pants are incredible.  These things are practically indestructible.  I have them in a half dozen colors.  Some of them I've been wearing for over six years.  Here's what I love about them:1.  Fit:  The cut is like dress pants.  Especially the 874 model.  I work at a financial services firm where looking the part is important and they have a dress code policy.  I can wear these to work with a dress shirt and people think I'm wearing dress pants.  They slightly taper to the bottom and they fall perfectly over dress shoes.2.  Material:  It is a really solid poly/cotton blend.  The stitching and hardware is very good quality.  I have never had a seam come undone or a button pop off.  Zipper never gets stuck.3.  Permanent Press:  Much better than dockers and all those other ones.  The permanent press lasts on these.  I can take them straight out of a hot dryer and I have a perfectly pressed dress pant.4.  Comfort:  A little stiff when you get them brand new... need to be broken in a bit by wearing a couple of times and a wash.5.  Color fast:  The colors remain true.  No bleeding or fading.  I have dark ones which have been through the wash and they still look like the original color.  I can't say this about any other cotton/blend pants.6.  Stain resistant:  I can spill food on it and as long as I rinse it off, it's as if nothing happened.  The material is thick so liquids don't immediately soak in.7.  Price:  They are priced right at about $20.  Try finding all the attributes listed for that price in another pant.8.  Consistency:  I have been buying the same cut for years and they are exactly the same.  I don't have to worry about them changing the design to follow the trendy fads of the year.9.  Temperature control:  During winter, the thicker material helps keep me warm without having to wear leggings.  The thicker material also acts as a wind block, unlike thinner pants.10.  Travelling:  For all the attributes listed, they are the pants for travelling.  Low maintenance, high performance.

These are like dress pants in more industrial disguise
 
The build quality of Dickies pants are incredible.  These things are practically indestructible.  I have them in a half dozen colors.  Some of them I've been wearing for over six years.

Dickies pants are the best ... like Kevlar for the office.
","
I love these pants.  From their cardboard-like stiffness to their seat-belt-rough texture, Dickies are the best.  I do take the bright tag off the back so that I can wear these to my office job (people don't like to see me in ""blue collar"" clothes when I'm handling their finances), but they are great.  They don't shrink or fade, and they're practically indestructible.  The best part is that they're so affordable that I can have a pair for each day of the week.  The *only* thing I wish they would change is the height of the waist.  For me, they would be more comfortable (and I think look more stylish) if the waist sat just a little lower.  At the end of the day, these are still my favorite dress pants of all time.  Get some... expect them to feel like kevlar (and wear like it too), and you'll love them.  ... a true bargain in a world of cost-cutting.

Untrue to waist sizing - may consider at least two sizes larger.

Sizing for these pants were not as expected.  I normally wear a size waist 40"" and when I received and tried pants on, I think it could have been sized as a 36"" waist.  I returned for larger size (42"") and again was extremely disappointed.  The waist maybe at best a 38"".  I am returning these pants for a refund!

I mean, they're dickies, you know? They're what you'd expect. A bit stiff, but they're work pants so it's what you'd expect. They're tough, perhaps a bit baggy, but when wearing work pants you're not trying to win any fashion contests. They do the job you need them too. They're not scratchy, or uncomfortable, up just stuff at first.

I've had some pairs for over 5 years now with lots of washes and wearing daily.  Material is so much more comfortable than jeans after a couple washes.  In fact, i use to wear jeans every day.  No more.  Only my Dickies.

I had to send the pants back because they were too small. My son has a 38 waist and 36 inseam but his thighs are larger due to his size of 6' 5"" tall height.

Work and Dress pants

I often must transition from labor to jacket and tie with no time to change into a suit.These flat front pants have no visible markings to identify them as work pants, and with a little brushing offcan pass for dress pants, yet they are far more durable and longer lasting than standard dress pants or khakis.I own ten pairs of these and after years of trial and error have found that no other pants are in the same category.If the fabric was even of a slightly higher grade, these Dickies would easily earn 5 stars from me.

Waist size, waaaaaay off. Failure

If you really want a pair, order two sizes larger then you regularly wear.  Whoever is in charge of measuring Dickies on the assembly line, they are overwhelming failures. I have purchased Dickies shorts in the past and found that they (more often than not) run small/tight in the waist. Keeping that in mind, I ordered my pair larger. I have a 36"" waist and order a 38"" waist pair of these pants. After getting them, I tried them on right after I took them out of their packaging. These things are sooo small/tight I can only think they have a 33"" or 34"" waist! I double checked their size tag and sure enough, it reads 38""x34"". Unbelievable. Luckily the other pants I ordered at the same time, from a different company/brand, fit perfectly. Way to fail Dickies, way to fail.

Dickies used to be great . But now ever couple of months these pants rip and tear open at the croch area . And over time the whole is so big I could put my whole hand through them ..which then I end up spending more and more on pants only to have them last for 2 -3 Months .

These pants are good enough to take a beating 8hr's a day 5 times a week. The fit seems a little tight around the waist ,as if they are actually half a size off. Overall these slacks are great and they last.

One works great and I work in daily
","
I  ordered two pairs of pants, both same style and size.  One works great and I work in daily.  The other three clasp broke on day 3 of use.  It seems as if it wasnt made correctly as it came off with almost no force. So now I have no use for a pair of pants I can't clasp together. I  would replace the pair but its been 32 days since purchase, and it won't let me after 30 days. Being that they broke after day 3 I would have tried sooner had I known it was such a short replace/refund time.

Awesome work pants, i love the material usually I wear a 28x30 but the 29x30 worked perfect.UPDATE: It's been nearly 3 months I've been wearing these pants about 3-4 times a week. Still no shrinkage, holes, stains or rips. They wash and dry very nice and the best part is I never have to iron them. They fit snug ever since my first time wearing them, which looks professional, Baggy clothing is bad!

I've yet to encounter any sort of wear and tear on my pair. Still highly recommend.

WAY too tight, you may need to go up 3 sizes
","
I read the reviews on here and was naturally expecting that the pants would be too tight, so I got the size that was 2 up from what I usually wear. But that wasn't enough! If I had known these would be that tight, I would've gone up a little more (maybe 3-4 sizes to account for dryer shrinkage). I bought two pairs and will likely be sending the other one back. This product needs to be resized by the manufacturer, but in the meantime... I highly recommend buying pants that would normally be too big for you. The skin on your waist will thank you. Mine has been terrorized.On the plus side, they are pretty thick and protect my sensitive legs from the winter weather. I imagine they wouldn't be too comfortable in the summer, though.

My size 36 pants are getting tight at the waist so I've started getting size 38.  The Dickies size 38 seemed almost, but not as tight as the other 36 pants I already own.  Other 38 pants I've bought seem a tad larger.  Also, the top part of the pants seems to fold over due to my girth, showing a white area that's quite obvious and looks as if one's underwear is showing.  All said though, it's a good price for these pants.  Haven't had the first washing yet and don't know if it fades or what happens when washed.

Poor construction does not last
","
I have been wearing dickies for the last twenty years and have relied on the sturdy build comfort they offer.  The last two batches I have purchased have ruined the image of quality I have come to associate with the dickies brand. The first problem I now have with the product is the material, its rough  ten washes in and its like sand paper crossed with plywood. The other main complaint I have is the way the pants are constructed using a single thread to hold the inner and outer pieces together along the top of the belt line. Once the single thread holding the pants together breaks the product quickly falls apart. I purchased twelve pants in two different batches and two different sizes and nine broke.I don't know if i snaged the thread on something on the job site or it just broke, to be honest it should not matter one stich failing should not destroy a product.

Why buy jeans when you can buy Dickies?
","
Dickies makes a quality product. The fabric is super durable, comfortable after a few washes, and the cut of the pants is classic. I purchased two pair for my husband and he claims that he will never buy jeans again - they just don't compare to Dickies when it comes to durability. The waist measurements run a little small, so I recommend ordering one waist size larger. Luckily, my husband had already discovered this before I ordered these and the next size up fits perfectly!

One word of caution though: make sure you are outside shen you take them out of the package. Let them air for a bit then straight into the washer. They have a very strong chemical/urea type smell until they are washed.

I didn't like the polyester fabric to begin with. It was heavier and harder than what I wanted. I was looking for something softer and lighter to wear casually and for long hours like a pair of khaki pants. This was my fault because I didn't pay close attention to the type of fabric listed. Some people might like it though because it can be sturdier and more resistant to heavy use.Note that the color listed as ""khaki"" is not a classic beige khaki. It has a bit of an olive tint which you can't tell that well from looking at the pictures. I think the ""desert sand"" might be closer to a beige but I'm not that sure since I never ordered it.I ended up returning them mostly because they were the wrong size. They run smaller and shorter than the sizes I normally wear, which tend to be consistent even across multiple brands. I had to sort of squeeze myself for them to close. The length was too short as well and I could clearly tell when I'd sit. If you order them, I suggest trying a size bigger and longer. Even better, physically try them first at a nearby store if possible. This is one of the reasons I don't like ordering clothes or shoes online. Can't try them on or look at them close enough. Fortunately, Amazon makes returns easy. Still, it's a bit of a hassle having to order and send back multiple sizes.

Very snug, but the unusable pockets were the killer
","
These fit terribly in my opinion. The pockets on these pants are horrible, especially for work pants. If they were dress pants, and I wasn't expected to put anything in my pockets then no problem. But, I imagine with work pants, most people will be keeping stuff in their pockets. These pockets were easily 1 to 2 inches shallower than comparable denim jeans pockets I owned. I was very disappointed. The fit was snug, but apparently these are a truer fit than regular denim, but I didn't find them comfortable in my size, which was hard get as I am taller. Ended up returning as unuseable.

Love these pants, but sizing is inconsistent
","
I wear these all the time for work. They always look fresh pressed but don't require any ironing. Material is extremely durable, but be warned it is certainly stiffer than you may be used to. The fit is definitely small and unpredictable with these. Even if you buy one set of 874 work pants in one color and size, the next time you order the size may be completely off. Thankfully there are free returns so you can get what you need.I normally wear a 34x40 jeans. For these 874 work pants I own three pairs, two of which are 36x30 and the other pair is 38x30. Make sure you order a waist size 2-4 inches larger than you normally wear.

Dickies are great
","
That said, when I say it fit ""as expected"", that means it's at least 2 inches smaller in the waist than the size given. That is how Dickies work pants are sized (so are Carharts). So 44 fits like a 42, 42 fits like a 40, etc. They do NOT shrink, however. It's just how Dickies sizes these type of pants for some reason. I only wore these a handful of times because I ended up losing a lot of weight. One pair I bought, the zipper pull came off after only wearing them a few times, but this is the first time it's happened with any Dickies I've bought over the years.

Some people have complained the pants are a little small but they were fine for me.  They are good and durable work pants.  If perfectly new you might be able to pass them off as regular everyday pants but that isn't exactly what their meant for.  They hold up well to grease and oil as a mechanic, just wash your work clothes separately (duh) and you will be fine.

I love Dickies, but hate their sizing inconsistencies. A 34 waist in these is to small, even though I wear a 32-33.

I have some Dickies uniform relaxed shorts that I can never seem to find anywhere  that fit perfect at 34. Come on Dickies, get it together!

Love the material!
","
First of all. I am in a wheelchair. That being said, I love these pants for a number of reasons. Most of all because they ARE 65% polyester, they are much better for sliding on a slide board to and from my wheelchair. Now the waist size is at least one size too small. I held them up to the 38"" I have now, and the 40's are the same. Also, I wanted at least one size bigger, as it's hard accessing pockets when you are sitting! One thing more, I loved the 17"" inseam shorts Dickie used to sell, so I buy the shortest inseam possible, usually 28, and turn them into long shorts!
